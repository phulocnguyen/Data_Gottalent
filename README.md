# Data Got Talent- SYNCH- Analyzing Customer Behavior and Crafting Strategies for Sustainable Growth in the Entertainment Industry
We conducted a detailed market analysis last May, focusing on customer behavior and habits. The notable point is the difference between buying tickets online and at the counter, as well as the habits of watching movies on specific days and time frames. Additionally, we have developed a Recommendation System to optimize customer experience. Through these analyses, we propose strengthening strategies for areas such as online ticket booking, screening time selection and increased promotion of famous films.
